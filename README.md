# 📇 Address Book in C

This project implements a **file-based Address Book system** in the **C programming language**, allowing users to store, retrieve, and manage contact information efficiently.  
It demonstrates key programming concepts like **structures**, **file handling**, and **modular programming**.

## 🧩 Overview

The **Address Book** lets users manage their contacts through a simple command-line interface.  
All contact information is saved in a data file, so your contacts persist even after closing the program.

## ⚙️ Features
 
✅ Persistent storage using file I/O  
✅ Simple text-based user interface  
✅ Error handling for invalid inputs  
✅ Modular structure with separate source files  

## 🧮 Menu Operations

Below are the main operations supported in this project:

1. 👤 **Create Contact** – Add a new contact with name, phone number, and email.  
2. 🔍 **Search Contact** – Search for a contact by name or phone number.  
3. ✏️ **Edit Contact** – Modify existing contact information.  
4. 🗑️ **Delete Contact** – Permanently remove a contact.  
5. 📋 **List All Contacts** – Display all stored contacts.  
6. 💾 **Save Contacts** – Save all contact information to file.  
7. 🔒 **Block Contact** – Mark a contact as blocked.  
8. 🚫 **List Blocked Contacts** – Display all blocked contacts.  
9. 🔓 **Unblock Contact** – Restore a blocked contact.  
10. 🚪 **Exit** – Exit the program safely after saving data.
## 🧱 Technologies Used

  **Language:** C  
  **Concepts:** Structures, File Handling, Pointers, Functions  
  **Compiler:** GCC  

## 📘 Learning Outcomes

During this project, I learned:
🧩 How to design modular C programs using header and source files.
📂 File handling using fopen(), fread(), fwrite(), and fclose().
🧠 Data structures like arrays and structures for record management.
💾 Persistent data storage techniques in C.
🧑‍💻 Using Git and GitHub for source control and documentation.
